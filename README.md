## Roger A. Cox

**DevSecOps • CI/CD Automation • Agile Delivery (SAFe) • Platform Enablement**

I build secure, repeatable delivery systems—turning **requirements into pipelines**, **pipelines into governed releases**, and **releases into measurable outcomes**. My work sits at the intersection of **GitLab CI/CD**, **DevSecOps controls**, and **SAFe execution** to help teams ship faster *without* sacrificing security, traceability, or quality.

## DevSecOps Summary (GitLab + SAFe)

I focus on **delivery systems that scale**—technically and organizationally:

- **CI/CD & Release Engineering:** Multi-stage pipelines (build → test → scan → package → deploy) with repeatable promotion patterns across environments.
- **Security as Code:** Integrate SAST/DAST/dependency/container scanning, SBOM-minded practices, and policy-driven gates that match enterprise compliance needs.
- **Traceability & Governance:** Tie issues/requirements to code, pipeline evidence, artifacts, and deployment history—supporting auditability without slowing teams down.
- **SAFe Delivery Enablement:** Support ART execution by aligning pipeline workflows to team/PI objectives, improving flow metrics, and reducing friction in the path to production.

## Professional Bio (CI/CD + Agile Focus)

I’m a DevSecOps/CI-CD practitioner with a strong Agile delivery foundation. I help teams move from “it works on my machine” to **reliable, secure, observable releases** by designing pipelines, controls, and team-friendly workflows. My experience blends **GitLab CI/CD** capability with **SAFe execution practices**—so engineering teams can deliver value consistently while meeting security and compliance expectations.

<!--
TODO (optional, recommended):
1) For each SAFe badge: open it on Credly → Share → Copy "public_url"
2) Replace the three SAFe <a href="..."> links that currently point to your profile with their specific public_url links.
That makes every badge click-through verifiable at the individual badge level.
